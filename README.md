# Predicting Customer Churn in E-commerce 🛍️

In this project, we will use machine learning to predict customer churn for an e-commerce company based on historical data.

## Dataset 📊

We will be using the Customer Behavior Dataset from a retail company. It includes data on browsing behavior, product views, and purchases. You can find the dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store) 🤖

## Steps 🚀

1.  **Collect and preprocess data:** Collect relevant data such as customer demographics, transaction history, browsing behavior, customer feedback, etc. from various sources. Preprocess the data by cleaning, transforming, and formatting it to make it ready for analysis. 📑
    
2.  **Exploratory data analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA on the preprocessed data to understand the distribution, correlation, and other statistical properties of the data. 🧐
    
3.  **Feature engineering:** Create new features from the existing data that can be useful in predicting customer churn. 🧰
    
4.  **Model selection:** Select an appropriate machine learning model for predicting customer churn. 🤖
    
5.  **Training and evaluation:** Train the selected model on the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 📈
    
6.  **Hyperparameter tuning:** Optimize the hyperparameters of the selected model to improve its performance. 🎚️
    
7.  **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict customer churn on new data. 🤞
    

## Conclusion 💡

Predicting customer churn is important for any e-commerce company as it helps in retaining customers and increasing revenue. By following the above steps, we can build a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn and help the company take appropriate actions to prevent it.
